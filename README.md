# 💧 Water Scarcity Analysis in Greece (2000–2023)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes national water abstraction and water use in Greece over the period 2000–2023 using Excel.  
The goal is to identify long-term trends, sectoral consumption patterns, and structural water stress.

## 🗂 Dataset
Source: Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT)  
Data includes:
- Total water abstraction
- Water use by sector (Agriculture, Industry, Households)
- Time series covering 2000–2023

## 🛠 Tools
- Microsoft Excel
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🔎 Process
- Cleaned and structured raw data
- Handled missing values (data gap 2008–2010)
- Calculated water stress indicator
- Created dynamic charts for trend and sector analysis

## 📈 Key Insights
- Post-2011 period shows consistently high water stress
- Agriculture dominates national water consumption
- Limited structural change in water use over time
- Clear long-term pressure on water resources

## 📷 Visualizations
The repository includes:
- Water abstraction vs water use trend
- Stacked column chart (water use by sector)
- 2023 sectoral distribution pie chart

## 📌 Conclusion
The analysis highlights structural dependence on agricultural water use and persistent pressure on national water resources, supporting the need for sustainable water management policies.
